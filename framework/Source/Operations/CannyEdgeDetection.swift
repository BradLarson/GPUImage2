/** This applies the edge detection process described by John Canny in
 
 Canny, J., A Computational Approach To Edge Detection, IEEE Trans. Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 8(6):679â€“698, 1986.

 It starts with a conversion to luminance, followed by an accelerated 9-hit Gaussian blur. A Sobel operator is applied to obtain the overall
 gradient strength in the blurred image, as well as the direction (in texture sampling steps) of the gradient. A non-maximum suppression filter
 acts along the direction of the gradient, highlighting strong edges that pass the threshold and completely removing those that fail the lower
 threshold. Finally, pixels from in-between these thresholds are either included in edges or rejected based on neighboring pixels.
